# Report Card
<h2>Project Overview:</h2>

This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making a class to represent a report card.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow a school to store a studentâ€™s grades for a particular year. This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Any constants contained in the class are never modified, and are logical choices for constant values.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The submitted project consists of a single .java file, titled ReportCard.java, contained in a .zip file.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The class contains appropriate variables to track information which belongs on a report card. The class does not contain variables which should belong, for instance, to a student, a teacher, a school, or a textbook.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The class contains at least one constructor which properly instantiates each variable in the class.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>Any private variables which might be read off of a report card should have a getter method to access them.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>All private variables require a setter method.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The class contains a toString() method which returns the contents of the class in a human-readable string. The toString() method should properly use the @Override notation.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The code compiles without errors</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
<br>The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.</b></li>
<br>
</ul>
